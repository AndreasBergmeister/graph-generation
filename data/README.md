# Data

This folder contains pickled data files that were used for the experiments described in the paper. Each file is a dictionary with three keys: `train`, `val`, and `test`. The value of each key is a list of [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) graphs that correspond to the respective dataset split.

The `Dataset.ipynb` notebook contains the code used to generate the datasets.
